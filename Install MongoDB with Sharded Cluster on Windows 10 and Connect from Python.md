# Install MongoDB with Sharded Cluster on Windows 10 and Access from Python
**MongoDB** is an open-source, cross-platform, **document-oriented NoSQL** (Not only SQL) database system developed in **C++** programming language. MongoDB is designed to handle large volume of structured and 
unstructured data that will be stored in BSON format _(binary style of JSON documents)_, which makes this database system extremely flexible and scalable with high performance and high available. 
MongoDB also provides driver support for most of the popular languages such as **C, C#, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala**, and **Swift**.

**MongoDB Atlas** is a cloud database solution that can be used by applications available globally and it offers fully managed service for MongoDB deployments across various cloud platforms 
such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. 
**MongoDB Cloud** is a unified data platform that includes a global cloud database, search, data lake, mobile, and application services.

**MongoDB** was initially developed as PaaS (Platform as a Service) in 2007 by a New York based organization named **10gen** and later in 2009, it was introduced as an open source database server that is 
maintained and supported by MongoDB Inc (**10gen** company name was renamed as **MongoDB Inc** in 2013).

Unlike relational databases where data is stored in tables and columns, MongoDB follows document-oriented data storage using the concept of Collections (equivalent to tables in RDBMS) and 
Documents (equivalent to records in RDBMS). MongoDB documents consist of key-value pairs which hold the actual data in JSON format. A group of documents are clubbed together into the collection and all 
collections are stored in databases. In summary, MongoDB databases are used to store one or more collections of documents that contain data.

It is important to understand that MongoDB is not a relational database and is different over RDBMS:
* MongoDB is a non-relational, document-oriented database management system and works on document-based database where as RDBMS is a Relational database management system and works on relational databases.
* MongoDB database consists of collections that contain documents with a list of key-value pairs which has data while RDBMS database consists of tables that contain columns and rows which has data.
* In MongoDB, the data is stored in the form of documents. In RDBMS, a table row represents a single structured data item.
* MongoDB follows schema-less structure where one collection in a database can hold different structure of documents. RBDMS follows schema structure where a prior definition of schema is needed for tables
  in the database.
* MongoDB supports MongoDB Query Language (MQL) of BSON type while RDBMS supports Structured Query Language (SQL).
* In MongoDB, the database can be scaled both horizontally and vertically. In RDBMS, the database can be scaled vertically.
* MongoDB does not support complex join operations while RDBMS supports complex joins.
* MongoDB is optimized for write performance while RBDMS is optimized for high performance joins across multiple tables. MongoDB uses internal memory for storing working sets which makes it almost 100 times
  faster than traditional database systems.
* MongoDB follows the CAP theorem when RBDMS follows ACID properties.

MongoDB can be deployed with different topologies:
1. **Standalone** – In Standalone mode, a single MongoDB instance is deployed on a single host which takes care of all activities. A standalone MongoDB instance is ideal for development and testing purposes
   but not a good choice for a Production deployment due to its single point of failure.
2. **Replica Set** – A replica set (also known as cluster) consists of multiple interconnected MongoDB instances (**mongod** process) such that each instance run on a separate server or container. These instances
   can play a **Primary** role or **Secondary** role or **Arbitrary** role. Replica set architecture has automatic failover mechanism to ensure a new primary node is elected if the current primary node fails
   and provides high availability and data redundancy.
3. **Sharded Cluster** – A sharded cluster is a special type of cluster which provides data redundancy and high availability similar to replica set cluster but it also distributes data across shards that are
   hosted on multiple servers providing horizontal scalability. A **shard** contains a subset of data set so that multiple shards together makeup the entire data set for the cluster. Sharding helps to
   distribute the read and write workload across the shards in the sharded cluster, allowing each shard to process a subset of cluster operations. Sharded cluster architecture consists of key components
   such as **Driver, Query Router** (also called as **mongos**), **Config Server** and **Shard**.

MongoDB is fully compatible with Windows OS, offering seamless integration and support for Windows environments. Whether you are running MongoDB on a local machine for development purposes or deploying it 
in a production environment on Windows servers, MongoDB provides native tools and utilities optimized for the Windows platform.

This document provides instructions to install MongoDB with two types of configuration – **Replica Set** and **Sharded Cluster** and execute queries against MongoDB using various tools such as 
**Mongo Shell, Mongo Compass** and **PyMongo** (Python library).  
You can also go through [this PDF document](/doc/Install%20Apache%20Kafka%203.8%20on%20Windows%2010.pdf) for installation steps along with screenshots.  
<br/>

## 1. Prerequisites:
The following prerequisites need to be installed before running Kafka.
1. **File Archiver:** Any file archiver such as **7zip** or **WinRAR** is needed to unzip the downloaded Spark binaries.
   **7zip** can be downloaded from the [official 7zip Downloads](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) website where as **WinRAR** can be downloaded
   from the [official RAR lab Downloads](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) website.
<br/>

## 2. Install Standalone MongoDB Instance:
MongoDB is available in two server editions – **Community** and **Enterprise**. The **Community** edition includes all basic features of MongoDB while the **Enterprise** edition provides several additional features 
such as LDAP authentication, Kerberos authentication, and System Event Auditing but this edition is available for MongoDB Enterprise subscribers only.

In this tutorial, we will install **MongoDB Community edition** in Windows system. 
* Go to [MongoDB Community Server Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) page.
* Choose the latest **Version** _(at the time of writing this document, the latest version is 8.0.4)_ and **Platform** as **Windows X64** and **Package** as **msi** and click on **Download** button which downloads
  the file into your **Downloads** folder in your machine.
* Right click on the downloaded file `mongodb-windows-x86_64-8.0.4-signed.msi` in your **Downloads** folder and select **Install**.
* It will start preparing to install and opens up a **MongoDB Setup wizard** where press **Next** to continue.
* Click on **I accept terms in the License Agreement** check box and press **Next**.
* On the **Setup Type** window, it provides two options **Complete** and **Custom**. While the **Complete** option installs all features in the default location, the **Custom** option allows us to install
  MongoDB in the custom path. So, press **Custom** button here.
* On the **Custom Setup** window, click on **Browse** and choose the location where you want to install it _(Here, I am choosing my install path as `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0`)_ and press **Next**.
* Since we want to run the MongoDB as a service, keep the option of installing MongoDB as a service and let it run as **Network Service** user. If you want to run the service as a local user, then select
  **Run service as a local or domain user** option and provide your Account details and press **Next**.
* Then, select **Install MongoDB Compass** checkbox to install the latest version of MongoDB Compass application. Press **Next** to continue.
* Now, everything is ready to install. Press **Install** button to continue.
* On the setup wizard, you can see that it starts with installing MongoDB components and registering them.
* It continues with installing MongoDB Compass application which may take a few minutes to complete.
* While MongoDB Compass installation is in progress, it opens up an application where you can see a message that MongoDB compass is being installed.
* After the installation is complete, it launches **MongoDB Compass** application with connections list to connect.
* On the **MongoDB Setup** wizard, click on **Finish** to exit.
<br/>

## 3. Install Standalone MongoDB Shell:
**MongoDB Shell** is a powerful command-based tool to interact with MongoDB databases. This tool is commonly used for **Database Administration, Database Migration, Quick Querying and Troubleshooting, 
Automation** and **Scripting and Application Development**.

By default, the **MongoDB Shell** is not installed with MongoDB Server. Follow the below step by step procedure to install MongoDB Shell in Windows System.
* Go to [MongoDB Shell Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell) page.
* Choose the latest **Version** _(at the time of writing this document, the latest version is 2.3.9)_ and **Platform** as **Windows X64** and **Package** as **msi** and click on **Download** button which
  downloads the file into your **Downloads** folder in your machine.
* Right click on the downloaded file `mongodb-2.3.9-x64.msi` in your **Downloads** folder and select **Install**.
* It opens up a **MongoDB Setup** wizard where press **Next** to continue.
* On the **Destination Folder** window, click on **Change** and choose the location where you want to install it.
  By default, it tries to install at `C:\Users\hp\AppData\Local\Programs\mongosh` location but you can choose your MongoDB install path _(in my case, it is `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin`)_ and
  press **Next**.
* Now, everything is ready to install MongoDB Shell. Press **Install** button to continue.
* On the setup wizard, you can see the installation process.
* Click on **Finish** to exit the wizard.
<br/>

## 4. Configure Standalone MongoDB:
After the installation is complete, you should configure the **PATH** environment variable defining the MongoDB `bin` location and verify the installation.

### 4.1. Setup Environment Variable:
You can configure the **PATH** environment variable under either **User environment variables** or **System environment variables** depending on MongoDB configuration needed **for a single user** 
or **for multiple users**.   
In this tutorial, we will update under **User environment variables** since we are configuring MongoDB for a single user but if you would like to configure for multiple users, then define System environment variables.  
<br/>

Follow these steps to set environment variables:
1. In the Windows search bar, start typing “environment variables” and select the first match which opens up **System Properties** dialog.
2. On the **System Properties** window, press **Environment Variables** button.
3. On the **Environment Variables** dialog, select **Path** variable and press **Edit** button. Press **New** and add the path where your MongoDB was installed
   _(in my case, it is D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin)_ and press **OK**.  
4. Press **OK** again to apply environment variable changes and close window.

### 4.2. Verify MongoDB Installation:
Open **Command Prompt** and run the following command to verify if MongoDB is installed properly:
```
mongod -version
```
It should display the version of MongoDB that was installed in your system.

Run the following command to verify if MongoDB Shell is installed properly:
```
mongosh --version
```
It should display the version of MongoDB Shell that was installed in your system.
<br/>
<br/>

## 5. Start Standalone MongoDB:
Now, start the MongoDB service and test the connection. 

### 5.1. Start MongoDB Service:
Since MongoDB was installed as a service, it would have started and running already.  

Follow these steps to verify if MongoDB is running:
* In the Windows search bar, start typing “services” and select **Services** application.
* On the **Services** application, look for **MongoDB Server** service and review the **Status** which would show **Running**. If it is not Running in your system, click on **Start** link to start the service.  

  You can also start the MongoDB service through **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** using the below command: 
  ```
  net start "MongoDB"
  ```

### 5.2. Verify MongoDB Status:
Open **Command Prompt** application and execute the below command:
```
sc query "MongoDB"
```
It should display the **STATE** as **RUNNING**.  

You can also verify if the MongoDB port (`27017`, by default) is listening by running the following command:
```
netstat -an | find "27017"
```

Additionally, you can open `mongod.log` file located at `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0\log location` and look for **Waiting for connections on port 27017** message which indicates that MongoDB service 
has been started and running successfully.
<br/>
<br/>

## 6. MongoDB Shell:
MongoDB provides an interactive tool called `mongosh` which is a JavaScript environment to communicate with MongoDB database and execute queries using `mongosh` commands.  

Using `mongosh`, you can connect to a MongoDB instance running either locally or remotely.  

**Connect to Local Instance:**  
Open **Command prompt** and simply run the below command to connect to a MongoDB instance locally. 
```
mongosh
```

The above command will connect to the MongoDB instance running in `localhost` on default port `27017`. This method is also equivalent to connecting with a connection string using below command:
```
mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017"
```

If you need to connect to a specific database (let’s say `admindb`), you will have to add the name of the database in the connection string as below:
```
mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017/admindb"
```

If you want to connect to a specific database (let’s say `admindb`) without connection string, just provide the database name in the mongosh command as below:
```
mongosh admindb
```

If your MongoDB instance is running on a custom port (let’s say `28089`), you can use `--port` command line option to connect:
```
mongosh --port 28089
```

**Connect to Remote Instance:**  
You can connect to a MongoDB instance running remotely using connection string as below:
```
mongosh "mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:29058"
```
In the above command, `mongodb0.example.com` is the remote host name and `29058` is the port where MongoDB instance is running.

You can also use command-line options to make a remote connection:
```
mongosh --host mongodb0.example.com --port 29058
```

You can connect to a MongoDB replica set using connection string as below:
```
mongodb://username:password@db0.example.com:27017,db1.example.com:27017,db2.example.com:27017/?replicaSet=myRepl
```
In the above command, `myRepl` is the replica set name that has 3 members with host names `db0.example.com`, `db1.example.com` and `db2.example.com` where MongoDB instances are running on `29017` port.

If you need to connect to MongoDB installed on cloud such as Mongo Atlas, use the below syntax:
```
mongodb+srv://[username:password@]host:port[/[defaultauthdb][?options]]
```
For example, use the below command to connect to `myRepl` replica set installed on host `mongodb0.example.com` with authorization source as `admin`:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@mongodb0.example.com/?authSource=admin&replicaSet=myRepl
```
<br/>

For now, open **Command Prompt** and run the below command to connect to our local MongoDB instance:
```
mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017"
```
When you are connected successfully, you can see the fully qualified connection string of the MongoDB instance and the installed versions of MongoDB, Mongosh on the window.  

**Note:** By default, Mongosh connects to `test` database (though this database is not available) and hence give you `test>` prompt to proceed with executing queries.

You can execute mongosh commands to access MongoDB.

### 6.1. Get Mongo:
Use the below command to get the current Mongo instance connection URL. 
```
db.getMongo()
```

### 6.2. Get Version:
Use the below command to get the installed version of MongoDB instance.
```
db.version()
```

### 6.3. Get Help:
Use `help()` command to get the list of commands that can be executed on MongoDB shell:
```
db.help()
```

### Insert Documents:
Run the following command to insert one document into a collection named `inventory` in the current database. The document data must be provided in JSON format with key-value pairs. If the given collection 
does not exist already in the database, the insert operation creates the collection and add a document into it.
```
db.inventory.insertOne(
   { item: "canvas", qty: 100, tags: ["cotton"], size: { h: 28, w: 35.5, uom: "cm" } , status: "A"  }
)
```
If the document insertion is successful, the `insertOne()` method returns `acknowledged` as `true` and provides the newly inserted document’s objectId i.e. `_id` field value.

Run the following command to insert multiple documents into a collection:
```
db.inventory.insertMany([
   { item: "journal", qty: 25, tags: ["blank", "red"], size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: "cm" } , status: "A" },
   { item: "mat", qty: 85, tags: ["gray"], size: { h: 27.9, w: 35.5, uom: "cm" } , status: "P" },
   { item: "mousepad", qty: 25, tags: ["gel", "blue"], size: { h: 19, w: 22.85, uom: "cm" } , status: "D" },
   { item: "paper", qty: 100, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: "in" }, status: "D" },
   { item: "planner", qty: 75, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30, uom: "cm" }, status: "D" },
   { item: "postcard", qty: 45, size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" },
])
```
When all documents insertion is successful, the `insertMany()` method returns `acknowledged` as `true` and provides the newly inserted documents `_id` field values.

### 6.4. Search Documents:
Run the following command to find a document that consists of `item: "canvas"` field in the `inventory` collection. If the collection consists of multiple documents which have 
`item: "canvas"`, then `find()` method retrieves the first record found.
```
db.inventory.find( { item: "canvas" } )
```

Run the following command to retrieve all documents from the `inventory` collection:
```
db.inventory.find( {} )
```

### 6.5. Update Documents:
To update a document, MongoDB provides many update operators, such as `$set` to modify field values. Refer [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/update/) to know 
more about update operators.

Use the following syntax while using update methods:
```
{
  <update operator>: { <field1>: <value1>, ... },
  <update operator>: { <field2>: <value2>, ... },
  ...
}
```

Run the following command to update the first document where `item equals "paper"`:
```
db.inventory.updateOne(
   { item: "paper" },
   {
     $set: { "size.uom": "cm", status: "P" },
     $currentDate: { lastModified: true }
   }
)
```

This update operation:
* uses the `$set` operator to update the value of the `size.uom` field to `"cm"` and the value of the `status` field to `"P"`.
* uses the `$currentDate` operator to update the value of the `lastModified` field to the current date. If `lastModified field` does not exist, `$currentDate` will create the field. 
* returns the `matchedCount` and `modifiedCount` to understand how many documents it was able to match with the given condition and were updated.

Run the following command to update all documents where `qty` less than `50`:
```
db.inventory.updateMany(
   { "qty": { $lt: 50 } },
   {
     $set: { "size.uom": "in", status: "P" },
     $currentDate: { lastModified: true }
   }
)
```
Once the above query is executed successfully, you will notice 3 documents have been matched and updated.

Mongosh also provides `replaceOne()` method to replace the entire content of a document except `_id` field. 

Run the following command to replace the first document from the `inventory` collection where `item: "in"`:
```
db.inventory.replaceOne(
   { item: "paper" },
   { item: "paper", instock: [ { warehouse: "A", qty: 60 }, { warehouse: "B", qty: 40 } ] }
)
```

### 6.6. Delete Documents:
To delete a document, MongoDB provides `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` methods. In these methods, you can specify a criteria or filters that identify documents to delete.

Use the following syntax to specify a query filter while using delete operations:
```
{ <field1>: { <query_operator1>: <value1> }, ... }
```
In the above syntax, the query operator can be `$eq` (for equal to), `$gt` (for greater than), `$gte` (for greater than or equal to), `$lt` (for less than), `$lte` (for less than or equal to), 
`$ne` (for not equal to) etc. Refer [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/#std-label-query-selectors) to know more about query operators.

Run the following command to delete the first document from the `inventory` collection where `status` is `"D"`:
```
db.inventory.deleteOne( { status: "D" } )
```
When the deletion of documents is successful, the `deleteOne()` method returns the `acknowledged` as `true` and provides the number of deleted documents.

Use the following command to delete all documents where `status` is `"A"`:
```
db.inventory.deleteMany({ status : "A" })
```

### 6.7. Create Database:
In MongoDB, databases are not created explicitly until some data is available. You can take the help of `use` command followed by a database name to switch to that database even if it does not exist. 

Run the below mongosh command to get the list of available databases in the current MongoDB instance:
```
show dbs
```

Run the below command to get the current database name:
```
db.getName()
```

Run the below mongosh command to switch to a database named `finance`.
```
use finance
```
 
### 6.8. Create Collection:
Use below command to explicitly create a collection in the current database:
```
db.createCollection("employee")
```

Use below command to get the list of available collections in the current database:
```
db.getCollectionNames()
```

You can also use the below command to fetch the available collections in the current database:
```
show collections
```

### 6.9. Drop Collection:
Use the following command to drop a collection named employee: 
```
db.employee.drop()
```

### 6.10. Drop Database:
Use the below mongosh command to remove the current database:
```
db.dropDatabase()
```

To understand more about mongsh methods, refer the official [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/).
<br/>

## 7. MongoDB Compass:
**MongoDB Compass** is a Graphical User Interface application provided for easy access to query, aggregate, and analyze Mongo data.

### 7.1. Connect Mongo:
Launch **MongoDB Compass** application in your Windows system. MongoDB Compass shows a default connection `localhost:27017` to connect to MongoDB instance running locally on default port `27017`.

If you would like to connect to either a remote host or to MongoDB running on a different port, click on **+** icon next to **CONNECTIONS** which opens a **New Connection** window where you need to specify 
the connection string and name for reference and press **Save & Connect**.

For now, click on **CONNECT** button next to `localhost:27017` to make a connection.

Once you are connected to the default localhost instance, you will see three default databases named `admin`, `config`, `local` and an additional database `test` that was created when we inserted documents 
into `inventory` collection through MongoDB Shell.

In the `local` database, you will see a collection named `startup_log` which consists of a document with list of key-value pairs which gives you the MongoDB startup information.

## 7.2. Create Database:
While creating a database from MongoDB Compass, it is necessary to specify the collection name without which database cannot be created.

* To create a new database, click on **+** icon next to `localhost:27010` connection.
* Specify the database name (such as `student`) and collection name (such as `student_list`) and press **Create Database**.
* After this, you can see that the new database and collection has been created.

### 7.3. Insert Documents:
MongoDB Compass provides two ways to insert documents into a collection:  
**Field-by-Field Editor** – You can use this option to insert a single document by selecting individual field values and types.  
**JSON Mode** - You can use this option to insert multiple documents at once as an array. It allows you to write JSON documents in the editor.

Follow the below steps to insert documents into the collection:
* Select `student_list` collection and click on **Add Data** dropdown and select **Insert Document** option.
* Here, you will see two views based on how you would like to insert documents.  
  If you press **{ }** brackets, it shows JSON view which is the default view to insert documents in JSON format where as if you press the list icon, it opens up Field-by-Field editor.
* In JSON view, enter the below content to insert 5 documents into the collection. Note that if you do not provide an ObjectId (`_id` field) in the document, Compass automatically generates an ObjectId
  for the inserted document. 
  ```
  [
    { "_id" : 101, "name" : "Akash", "gender" : "Male", "age" : 22 },
    { "_id" : 102, "name" : "Naina", "gender" : "Female", "age" : 20 },
    { "_id" : 103, "name" : "Sarala", "gender" : "Female", "age" : 22 },
    { "_id" : 104, "name" : "Surya", "gender" : "Male", "age" : 23 },
    { "_id" : 105, "name" : "Lakshman", "gender" : "Male", "age" : 20 }
  ]
  ```
* Once inserted, you can see the list of documents available in the collection

### 7.4. Modify Documents:
MongoDB Compass provides three ways to modify documents in a collection:  
**List view** – This is the default view where you can view document content in the form of a list. When you edit a document in this view, Compass performs a `findOneAndUpdate` operation and updates only 
those fields that you have changed.  
**Table view** – This view shows you the document content in a table format. When you edit a document in this view, Compass performs a `findOneAndUpdate` operation and updates only those fields that you have 
changed.  
**JSON Mode** – This view shows you the document content in JSON format. When you edit a document in this view, Compass performs a `findOneAndReplace` operation and replaces the entire document.
 
Follow the below steps to modify single document in the collection:
* Choose the default List view to make changes.

* To modify a document, hover over the document and click the pencil icon after which document enters into the edit mode where you can make changes to fields, values, or data types of values.
  * To add a new field in the document after an existing field, hover over the field and click on **+** sign.  
    For example, select the document with `_id:102` in `student_list` collection and click on **+** sign to the left of `age` field and you will see an option **Add field after age**.
    Then enter the new field name as `score` and value as `80`.
  * To modify an existing field name or value in the document, click on the respective field name or value.  
    For example, click on `age` field and change its name to `Age`.
  * To delete a field from a document, click the delete icon to the left of the field.
    Once deleted, the field is marked for removal and appears highlighted in red.
  * To revert changes to a document, hover over the edited field and click the revert icon which appears to the left of the field's line number.
  * If you want to exit the edit mode and cancel all pending changes to the document, you can click the **Cancel** button.

* When you are finished editing the document, click the **Update** button to commit your changes. 

* Once changes are updated, you can see it in the collection.

Follow the below steps to modify multiple documents in the collection. You can also perform bulk update operations on multiple documents by using **Update Documents** modal.
* From the **Documents** tab, enter the filter criteria on the **Query bar**. The filter criteria specified applies to the documents in the **Bulk Update** modal.
  If you want to update all documents in a collection, leave the Query bar blank.  
  For example, enter the following filter in the **Query bar** to filter male students and press **Find** button. Then press the **UPDATE** button to display the **Update Documents** modal.
  ```
  { gender: "Male" }
  ```

* The **Update Documents** modal displays the number of documents affected by the update at the top. In the modal, you can see the **Filter** field which displays the filter criteria specified on the Query bar. In the Update text field, enter the following syntax to increment the age by 5.
  ```
  {
    $inc: {age:5},
  }
  ```
  Optionally, you can save the update query in the **Update Documents** modal. Saving the query adds it to your favorite queries for that collection and allows you to load and copy the query after you close
  the modal. When you click the **Save** button on the bottom left of the modal, it asks you to enter a name for the update syntax and click the **Save** button.
  
* When you are finished adding the update query, click **Update Documents** button to update the documents.
  
* On the **Documents** tab, click on **Refresh** icon to see the modified age of 3 male students.

### 7.5. Delete Documents:
Follow the below steps to delete a single document in the collection:
* To delete a document, hover over the document and click the delete icon.  
  For example, select the document with `_id:103` in `student_list` collection and click on delete icon.

*	After clicking the delete icon, the document is flagged for deletion. Click on **Delete** to confirm the change.

* Once the document is deleted, you can see it in the collection.

Follow the below steps to delete multiple documents in the collection. You can also perform bulk delete operations by using **Delete Documents** modal.
* From the **Documents** tab, enter the filter criteria on the Query bar to filter documents to  be deleted. If you want to delete all documents in a collection, leave the Query bar blank.\
  For example, enter the following filter in the Query bar to filter male students and press **Find** button. Then press the **DELETE** button to display the **Delete Documents** modal.
  ```
  { gender: "Male" }
  ```
 
* The **Delete Documents** modal displays the number of documents affected by the delete at the top. In the modal, you can see the **Filter** field which displays the filter criteria specified on the Query bar
  and the **Preview** field with a preview of documents that will be deleted. 
 
  Optionally, you can export the delete query to a supported driver language such as C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby, or Rust. On the **Delete Documents** modal, click **Export** which opens up the
  **Export Delete Query To Language** modal that displays with the delete syntax populated under **My Delete Query**. You can convert the delete syntax to the required programming language and
  copy the converted syntax.

 * On the **Delete Documents** modal, click **Delete Documents** button.

* Since the delete operation cannot be undone, it asks for your confirmation. Click on **Delete documents** to confirm the deletion.

* On the **Documents** tab, click on **Refresh** icon and you can notice those documents were deleted.
 
### 7.6. Drop Collection:
To drop a collection:
* Click on 3 dots on the right of `student_list` collection and choose **Drop collection**.
* Enter the collection name in the text field and click on **Drop Collection**.
* You can notice that `student_list` collection and `student` database have been dropped.
 
**Note:** If the database consists of a single collection, the database will be auto-deleted as soon as the collection is deleted. 

### 7.7. Embedded MongoDB Shell:
**MongoDB Compass** provides an embedded shell i.e **mongosh**, a JavaScript environment to interact with MongoDB instances. You can use mongosh to test queries and operations in your database.

There are two ways to open the embedded mongosh:
* Click on **>_** icon on the right of your deployment name in the **Connections** sidebar.
* Click on **>_Open MongoDB shell** in the top right of any tab connected to a MongoDB deployment.

By default, mongosh connects to the `test` database. To use a different database, run the following command in mongosh and proceed with executing queries:
```
use database_name
```

To disable the embedded MongoDB shell, click on **Settings** icon next to **Compass**. On the **Settings** dialog box, go to **General** tab and uncheck **Enable MongoDB Shell** option and press **Save**.  

Once you disable it, you will see an error **MongoDB Shell is disabled in your Settings** on the mongosh tab.

## 8. Deploy MongoDB Replica Set:
Now, let us see how to create a replica set with a **primary**, **2 secondary** and **one arbiter** nodes.

For the purpose of this documentation, we will setup one arbiter and two secondary MongoDB instances running on different IP addresses and ports in the same Windows system but in the real-time project, 
we should configure one instance per system to setup Replica Set.

### 8.1. Shutdown Standalone Instance:
First, stop the standalone instance as below if it is already running: 

* Press **Windows+R** key in your keyboard to open **Run** application and type `services.msc` and press **OK**.
* On the **Services** application, look for **MongoDB Server** service and review the **Status** which shows **Running**. Click on **Stop** link to stop the service.  

  You can also stop the MongoDB service through **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** using the below command:
  ```
  net stop "MongoDB"
  ```
* Verify if the service is stopped successfully by executing the below command in **Command Prompt**:
  ```
  sc query "MongoDB"
  ```
  
### 8.2. Setup Multiple Instances:
Follow the below steps to create multiple MongoDB instances:
* Go to [MongoDB Community Server Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) page.
* Choose the latest **Version** _(at the time of writing this document, the latest version is 8.0.4)_ and **Platform** as **Windows X64** and **Package** as **zip** and click on **Download** button
  which downloads the file into your **Downloads** folder in your machine.
* Copy the downloaded file `mongodb-windows-x86_64-8.0.4.zip` from your **Downloads** folder into your MongoDB installation path _(in this case, it is `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server`)_.
* Once the file is copied, right click on the file and select **Extract Here** option to extract contents of it into the current directory. The zip file extraction may take a couple of minutes to finish.
* After finishing, you will see a folder named `mongodb-win32-x86_64-windows-8.0.4` which consists of MongoDB binaries.
* Rename the newly created folder as `Arbiter`.
* Take two copies of `Arbiter` folder and rename those copies as `Secondary1` and `Secondary2`.
* Create two sub-directories named `data` and `log` under `Arbiter`, `Secondary1` and `Secondary2` directories.

**Note:**   
The arbiter node uses data directory to store configuration data only without the actual datasets but until the arbiter node is added to the replica set, the arbiter acts like other instances and start up 
with a set of data files.

### 8.3. Set Replica Set Name:
In this tutorial, we will set our replica set name as `mongors0` in the configuration file for each MongoDB instance.

Open `mongod.cfg` file from the MongoDB installation location at `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin` and add the below lines to set the `replSetName` setting. 
```
replication:
  replSetName: "mongors0"
```
**Note:**  
MongoDB binaries which are **mongod** and **mongos** are bound to `localhost` (IP address: `127.0.0.1`) by default, which is why you see `bindIP` is set to `127.0.0.1` in the `mongod.cfg` file. 
When **mongod** and **mongos** are bound to `localhost`, they can accept connections from clients running on the same machine which means remote clients cannot connect to binaries that are bound only to 
`localhost`. To override the default binding and bind to other IP addresses, update the `bindIp` setting in the configuration file with a list of hostnames or IP addresses. For now, this is not needed.  

Next, copy the updated `mongod.cfg` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin` and place it under `Arbiter`, `Secondary1` and `Secondary2` directories at the below locations:  
`D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Arbiter\bin`  
`D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary1\bin`  
`D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary2\bin`

### 8.4. Configure Replica Set Members:
We will configure our replica set members such that `Secondary1` instance runs at IP address `127.0.0.2` on port `27018`, `Secondary2` instance runs at IP address `127.0.0.3` on port `27019` and 
`Arbiter` instance runs at IP address `127.0.0.4` on port `27020` and also update the storage path and log locations of secondary and arbiter instances.

**Note:**  Make sure that no process is running at `127.0.0.2 :27018`, `127.0.0.3:27019` and `127.0.0.4:27020` addresses in your Windows system. 

Open `Secondary1` instance `mongod.cfg` from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary1\bin` and update the following attributes:
```
storage:
  dbPath: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary1\data

# where to write logging data.
systemLog:
  destination: file
  logAppend: true
  path:  D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary1\log\mongod.log

# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27018
  bindIp: 127.0.0.2
```

Similarly, open `Secondary2` instance `mongod.cfg` from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary2\bin` and update the following attributes:
```
storage:
  dbPath: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary2\data

# where to write logging data.
systemLog:
  destination: file
  logAppend: true
  path:  D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary2\log\mongod.log

# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27019
  bindIp: 127.0.0.3
```

Similarly, open `Arbiter` instance `mongod.cfg` from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Arbiter\bin` and update the following attributes:
```
storage:
  dbPath: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Arbiter\data

# where to write logging data.
systemLog:
  destination: file
  logAppend: true
  path:  D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Arbiter\log\mongod.log

# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27020
  bindIp: 127.0.0.4
```
 
### 8.5. Start all MongoDB Instances:
Now, start all mongo DB instances including Primary, Secondary1, Secondary2 and Arbiter.

#### Start Primary Instance:
Open a new **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** and execute the below command to start the first and primary instance.
```
mongod --config D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin\mongod.cfg
```

After executing the command, do not close the window. In couple of minutes, MongoDB instance would be started. To verify this, you can open `mongod.log` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\8.0\log` and 
look for messages **"Waiting for connections" port: 27017** and **"mongod startup complete"** which indicate that MongoDB instance has been started successfully.

You can also verify if the primary instance port `27017` is listening by running the following command on another **Command Prompt** window:
```
netstat -an | find "27017"
```

#### Start Secondary1 Instance:
Open a new **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** and execute the below command to start the first secondary instance.
```
mongod --config D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary1\bin\mongod.cfg
```
After executing the command, do not close the window. In couple of minutes, MongoDB instance would be started. To verify this, you can open `mongod.log` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary1\log` and 
look for messages **"Waiting for connections" port: 27018** and **"mongod startup complete"** which indicate that MongoDB instance has been started successfully.

You can also verify if the `secondary1` instance port `27018` is listening by running the following command on another **Command Prompt** window:
```
netstat -an | find "27018"
```

#### Start Secondary2 Instance:
Open a new **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** and execute the below command to start the second secondary instance.
```
mongod --config D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary2\bin\mongod.cfg
```

After executing the command, do not close the window. In couple of minutes, MongoDB instance would be started. To verify this, you can open `mongod.log` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Secondary2\log` and 
look for messages **"Waiting for connections" port: 27019** and **"mongod startup complete"** which indicate that MongoDB instance has been started successfully.

You can also verify if the `secondary2` instance port `27019` is listening by running the following command on another **Command Prompt** window:
```
netstat -an | find "27019"
```

#### Start Arbiter Instance:
Open a new **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** and execute the below command to start the arbiter instance.
```
mongod --config D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Arbiter\bin\mongod.cfg
```

After executing the command, do not close the window. In couple of minutes, MongoDB instance would be started. To verify this, you can open `mongod.log` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Arbiter\log` and 
look for messages **"Waiting for connections" port: 27020** and **"mongod startup complete"** which indicate that MongoDB instance has been started successfully.

You can also verify if the `arbiter` instance port `27020` is listening by running the following command on another **Command Prompt** window:
```
netstat -an | find "27020"
```

### 8.6. Initialize Replica Set with Primary:
Open a new **Command Prompt** to execute the below command to connect to the MongoDB server instance. Here, `27017` is the default port where our MongoDB server was installed.
```
mongosh --port 27017
```

Run the following mongosh commands to initialize the replica set with the current instance running on `localhost` (IP address `127:0.0.1`) listening on port `27017` which is our primary instance.
```
rsconf={_id:"mongors0", members:[{_id:0,host:"localhost:27017"}]}
rs.initiate(rsconf)
```
In the above replica set configuration (`rsconf` variable), we have set the `_id` to our replica set name `mongors0` and assignned members with `_id` as `0` and host as `localhost:27017`. 
Then, initialized replica set using `rs.initiate()` function.

After the replica set is initialized, it initially shows that the current instance is directed to **secondary** but, in few seconds, it is directed to **primary**.

Use the following mongosh command to get the replica set current configuration where you can see one member running at `localhost:27017` got added.
```
rs.conf()
```

Use the following mongosh command to get the status of replica set where you can see the current instance `localhost:27017` is set to **PRIMARY**.
```
rs.status()
```

You can run any queries to read or write data in the mongosh session which is connected to primary instance.

Use below mongosh command to get the list of current databases on the existing MongoDB server instance.
```
show dbs
```

### 8.7. Add Secondary Members to Replica Set:
In the existing mongosh session (that is connected to primary instance running on `27017` port), run the following commands to add our secondary instances running on hosts `127.0.0.2:27018` and 
`127.0.0.3:27019`. Note that you can add members only when you are connected to primary instance.
```
rs.add("127.0.0.2:27018")
rs.add("127.0.0.3:27019")
```

You can also use the below syntax to add members:
```
rs.add({host:"127.0.0.2:27018"})
rs.add({host:"127.0.0.3:27019"})
```

Check the status of replica set where you should see one **PRIMARY** and two **SECONDARY** members.
```
rs.status()
```

### 8.8. Add Arbiter Member to Replica Set:
Before adding arbiter to replica set, it is necessary to set the cluster-wide write concern, otherwise MongoDB throws an error 
**“Reconfig attempted to install a config that would change the implicit default write concern. Use the setDefaultRWConcern command to set a cluster-wide write concern and try the reconfig again”**

**Write Concern** describes the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for write operations to either standalone Mongo or replica sets or sharded clusters. Replica sets and sharded clusters support 
global (cluster-wide) default write concern which is used for operations that do not specify an explicit write concern. For more information, 
read [this MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/write-concern/#std-label-wc-ack-behavior).

In the existing mongosh session which is connected to primary instance running on `27017` port, run the following command to set the `defaultWriteConcern` property. 
In this setting, `w : 2` indicates Mongo requires acknowledgement for write operations from the primary and one of secondary instances _(you can also set `w:0` requesting no acknowledgement from any member, 
`w:1` requesting acknowledgment from the primary alone)_
```
db.adminCommand({
   "setDefaultRWConcern" : 1,
   "defaultWriteConcern" : {
     "w" : 2
   }
 })
```
  
Now, run the following mongosh command to add the arbiter instance running on host `127.0.0.4:27020`. Note that you can add arbiter only when you are connected to primary instance.
```
rs.addArb("127.0.0.4:27020")
```
 
Check the status of replica set where you should see one **PRIMARY**, two **SECONDARY** and one **ARBITER** members.
```
rs.status()
```

### 8.9. Validate Replication:
Now that replica set is configured successfully, we will verify if the replication from Primary to Secondary instances is working as expected.

Open a new **Command Prompt** and run the following command to connect to the first secondary instance.
```
mongosh --host 127.0.0.2 --port 27018
```

If you are not sure whether you are connected to a secondary instance, then use the below mongosh command which tells you if this is a primary or secondary instance.
```
rs.isMaster()
```

You can also use the below mongosh command to know which instance that you are connected to currently and what the primary is.
```
db.hello()
```

Let us try to do a write operation on the secondary instance by running the below mongosh command:
```
db.tech.insertOne({name:"MongoDB"})
```
Here,  document insertion fails because any write operation is allowed on the primary instance only.

Open a new **Command Prompt** and connect to the primary instance as below:
```
mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017"
```

When you connect to any Mongo instance, it navigates you to `test` database by default (though this database does not exist).

Run the below mongosh command to insert a record into a collection named `tech` in the current `test` database:
```
db.tech.insertOne({name:"MongoDB"})
```
If the document insertion is successful, it provides the newly inserted document’s objectId value.

Verify if `tech` collection got created in `test` database using below mongosh commands:
```
show dbs
use test
show collections
exit
```

Connect to the first secondary instance running at `127.0.0.2:27018` and verify if you can see the newly created `test` database and `tech` collection using the below commands.
```
mongosh "mongodb://127.0.0.2:27018"
```
```
show dbs
use test
show collections
exit
```

Connect to other secondary instance running at `127.0.0.3:27019` and verify if you can see the newly created `test` database and `tech` collection using the below commands.
```
mongosh "mongodb://127.0.0.3:27019"
```
```
show dbs
use test
show collections
exit
```

Connect to the arbiter instance running at `127.0.0.4:27020`
```
mongosh "mongodb://127.0.0.4:27020"
```

Execute the below command and you will see an error **MongoServerError[NotPrimaryOrSecondary]: node is not in primary or recovering state**. This is because When you try to execute any database command on 
the arbiter instance, it throws error since Arbiter is not meant for any data storage.
```
show dbs
```

### 8.10.	Validate Primary Election:
First, shutdown the primary instance.
* Open a new **Command Prompt** as **Administrator** and run the following command to find the process id where the primary instance (`127.0.0.1:27017`) is running:
  ```
  netstat -ano | findstr 127.0.0.1:27017 | findstr LISTENING
  ```

  Get the process ID given by the above command, replace it with `PROCEES_ID` in the below command and execute it to kill the process.
  ```
  taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID /F
  ```
* You can also simply go to the **Command Prompt** where primary instance is running and press **Ctrl+C** or close the window to shut down the primary.

Then, open `mongod.log` of arbiter instance at `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Arbiter\log` where you should see messages such as **PrimarySteppedDown: No primary exists currently**, 
**Responding to vote request, Restarting heartbeats after learning of a new primary, Member is in new state**, etc. indicating that it is able to elect new primary when the existing primary is not available. 
<br/>
<br/>

## 9. Deploy MongoDB Sharded Cluster:
Now, we will work on how to setup a MongoDB sharded cluster with the **config replica set**, **2 shard replica sets** and **query router**.

For the purpose of this documentation, we will setup the **config replica set with one primary instance and one secondary instance**, **2 shard replica sets each with one primary and two secondary instances** 
and **one query router instance** running on different IP addresses and ports in the same Windows system but in the real-time project, we should configure one instance per system to setup the cluster.

### 9.1. Shutdown Previous MongoDB Instances:
Before proceeding further, first shutdown all instances and delete secondary and arbiter instances that were created earlier during replica set configuration. If you have not setup the replica set earlier, 
you can skip this step.

Open a new **Command Prompt** as **Administrator** and run the following commands
* Find the process id where the primary instance `127.0.0.1:27017` is running and run `taskkill` command:
  ```
  netstat -ano | findstr 127.0.0.1:27017 | findstr LISTENING
  taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID /F
  ```
  You may not see this instance is running, since it was shutdown earlier while validating primary election scenario in replica set configuration.

* Find the process id where the secondary1 instance `127.0.0.2:27018` is running and run `taskkill` command:
  ```
  netstat -ano | findstr 127.0.0.2:27018 | findstr LISTENING
  taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID /F
  ```

* Find the process id where the secondary2 instance `127.0.0.3:27019` is running and run `taskkill` command:
  ```
  netstat -ano | findstr 127.0.0.3:27019 | findstr LISTENING 
  taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID /F
  ```

* Find the process id where the arbiter instance `127.0.0.4:27020` is running and run `taskkill` command:
  ```
  netstat -ano | findstr 127.0.0.4:27020 | findstr LISTENING
  taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID /F
  ```

When all instances were shutdown, go to the MongoDB install path at `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server` and remove `Arbiter`, `Secondary1` and `Seconary2` folders.

### 9.2. Setup Multiple Instances:
Follow the below steps to create multiple MongoDB instances for sharded cluster:
* Go to [MongoDB Community Server Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) page.
* Choose the latest **Version** _(at the time of writing this document, the latest version is 8.0.4)_ and **Platform** as **Windows X64** and **Package** as **zip** and click on **Download** button
  which downloads the file into your **Downloads** folder in your machine.
* Copy the downloaded file `mongodb-windows-x86_64-8.0.4.zip` from your **Downloads** folder into your MongoDB installation path _(in this case, it is `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server`)_.
* Once the file is copied, right click on the file and select **Extract Here** option to extract contents of it into the current directory. The zip file extraction may take a couple of minutes to finish.
* After finishing, you will see a folder named `mongodb-win32-x86_64-windows-8.0.4` which consists of MongoDB binaries.
* Rename the newly created folder as `ConfigSrvr1`.
* Create two sub-directories named `data` and `log` under `ConfigSrvr1` directory.
* Take two copies of `ConfigSrvr1` folder and rename those copies as `ConfigSrvr2`, `Shard1Srvr1`, `Shard1Srvr2`, `Shard1Srvr3`, `Shard2Srvr1`, `Shard2Srvr2`, `Shard2Srvr3` and `RouterSrvr`.

### 9.3.	Create Config Server Replica Set:
In this tutorial, we will setup the config server instances such that they are running under different hosts and ports as below:
`ConfigSrvr1` instance runs at IP address `127.0.1.1` on port `27018` and `ConfigSrvr2` instance runs at IP address `127.0.1.2` on port `27018`.

**Note:**  Make sure that no process is running at `127.0.1.1 :27018` and `127.0.1.2:27018` addresses in your Windows system. 

#### Configure Config Server Instances:
Go to `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr1\bin` and create `mongod.cfg` file and add the below contents into it. 
```
storage:
  dbPath: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr1\data

systemLog:
  destination: file
  logAppend: true
  path: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr1\log\mongod.log

net:
  bindIp: 127.0.1.1
  port: 27018
  
replication:
  replSetName: configrs

sharding:
  clusterRole: configsvr
```

Similarly, go to `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr2\bin` and create `mongod.cfg` file and add the below contents into it.
```
storage:
  dbPath: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr2\data

systemLog:
  destination: file
  logAppend: true
  path: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr2\log\mongod.log

net:
  bindIp: 127.0.1.2
  port: 27018
  
replication:
  replSetName: configrs

sharding:
  clusterRole: configsvr
```

#### Start Config Server Instances:
To start `ConfigSrvr1` instance, open a new **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** and execute the below command:
```
mongod --config D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr1\bin\mongod.cfg
```

After executing the command, do not close the window. In couple of minutes, MongoDB instance would be started. You can open `mongod.log` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr1\log` and 
look for messages **"Listening on address 127.0.1.1:27018"** which indicate that MongoDB instance has been started successfully.

You can also verify if the address `127.0.1.1:27018` is listening by running the following command on another **Command Prompt** window:
```
netstat -an | find "127.0.1.1:27018"
```

To start `ConfigSrvr2` instance, open a new **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** and execute the below command:
```
mongod --config D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr2\bin\mongod.cfg
```

After executing the command, do not close the window. In couple of minutes, MongoDB instance would be started. You can open `mongod.log` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr2\log` and 
look for messages **"Listening on address 127.0.1.2:27018"** which indicate that MongoDB instance has been started successfully.

You can also verify if the address `127.0.1.1:27018` is listening by running the following command on another **Command Prompt** window:
```
netstat -an | find "127.0.1.2:27018"
```

#### Initiate Config Server Replica Set:
You can connect to any config server instance to initialize the config server replica set

Open a new **Command Prompt** and execute the below command to connect to the `ConfigSrvr1` MongoDB server instance listening at `127.0.1.1:27018` address.
```
mongosh --host 127.0.1.1 --port 27018
```
When you are connected successfully, it will give you `test>` prompt to access the `test` database by default.

On the `test>` prompt, run the following command to initialize the replica set with 2 config servers running at `127.0.1.1:27018` and `127.0.1.2:27018`. Make sure that the replica set name given in the 
`_id` field below must match with the `replSetName` value in the `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\ConfigSrvr1\mongod.cfg` file.
```
rs.initiate(
  {
    _id : "configrs",
    members: [
      { _id : 0, host : "127.0.1.1:27018" },
      { _id : 1, host : "127.0.1.2:27018" }
    ]
  }
)
```
If the replica set is initiated successfully, the `rs.initiate()` method returns `ok` as `1` and provides the `clusterTime` details. It initially shows that the current instance is directed to **secondary** 
but, in few seconds, it is directed to **primary**.

Run the following command to get the replica set current configuration where you can see 2 members running at `127.0.1.1:27018` and `127.0.1.2:27018` got added to the replica set:
```
rs.conf()
```

Run the following command to get the status of replica set where you can see the current instance `127.0.1.1:27018` is set to **PRIMARY** and the other instance `127.0.1.2:27018` is set to **SECONDARY**.
```
rs.status()
```

### 9.4. Create Shard Clusters:
In this tutorial, we will setup 2 shard clusters such that they are running under different hosts and ports as below:  
**Shard Replica Set1:**  
`Shard1Srvr1` instance runs at IP address `127.0.2.1` on port `27019`, `Shard1Srvr2` instance runs at IP address `127.0.2.2` on port `27019` and `Shard1Srvr3` instance runs at IP address `127.0.2.3` 
on port `27019`.  

**Shard Replica Set2:**  
`Shard2Srvr1` instance runs at IP address `127.0.3.1` on port `27019`, `Shard2Srvr2` instance runs at IP address `127.0.3.2` on port `27019` and `Shard2Srvr3` instance runs at IP address `127.0.3.3`
on port `27019`. 

**Note:**  Make sure that no process is running at `127.0.2.1 :27019`, `127.0.2.2 :27019`, `127.0.2.3 :27019`, `127.0.3.1 :27019`, `127.0.3.2 :27019` and `127.0.3.3:27019` addresses in your Windows system. 

#### Configure Shard Server Instances:
Follow the below steps to setup the first shard replica set:
* Go to `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Shard1Srvr1\bin` and create `mongod.cfg` file and add the below contents into it. 
  ```
  storage:
    dbPath: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Shard1Srvr1\data
  
  systemLog:
    destination: file

```

#### Initiate Shard Server Replica Sets:
Follow the below steps to setup the first shard replica set:
* Open a new **Command Prompt** and execute the below command to connect to the `Shard1Srvr1` MongoDB server instance listening at `127.0.2.1:27019` address.
  ```
  mongosh --host 127.0.2.1 --port 27019
  ```
  When you are connected successfully, it will give you `test>` prompt to access the `test` database by default.
  
* On the `test>` prompt, run the following command to initialize the replica set with 3 shard servers running at `127.0.2.1:27019`, `127.0.2.2:27019` and `127.0.2.3:27019`. Make sure that the replica set name
  given in the `_id` field below must match with the `replSetName` value in the `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Shard1Srvr1\mongod.cfg` file.
  
  ```
  rs.initiate(
    {
      _id : "shard1rs",
      members: [
        { _id : 0, host : "127.0.2.1:27019" },
        { _id : 1, host : "127.0.2.2:27019" },
        { _id : 2, host : "127.0.2.3:27019" }
      ]
    }
  )
  ```
  If the replica set is initiated successfully, the `rs.initiate()` method returns `ok` as `1` and provides the `clusterTime` details. It initially shows that the current instance is directed to **secondary** 
  but, in few seconds, it is directed to **primary**.
  
* Run the following command to get the replica set current configuration where you can see 3 members running at `127.0.2.1:27019`, `127.0.2.2:27019` and `127.0.2.3:27019` got added to the replica set:
  ```
  rs.conf()
  ```
  
* Run the following command to get the status of replica set where you can see the current instance `127.0.2.1:27019` is set to **PRIMARY** and the other 2 instances `127.0.2.2:27019` and `127.0.2.3:27019` 
  are set to **SECONDARY**.
  ```
  rs.status()
  ```

Follow the below steps to setup the second shard replica set:
* Open a new **Command Prompt** and execute the below command to connect to the `Shard2Srvr1` MongoDB server instance listening at `127.0.3.1:27019` address.
  ```
  mongosh --host 127.0.3.1 --port 27019
  ```
  When you are connected successfully, it will give you `test>` prompt to access the `test` database by default.
  
* On the `test>` prompt, run the following command to initialize the replica set with 3 shard servers running at `127.0.3.1:27019`, `127.0.3.2:27019` and `127.0.3.3:27019`. Make sure that the replica set name
  given in the `_id` field below must match with the `replSetName` value in the `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\Shard2Srvr1\mongod.cfg` file.
  
  ```
  rs.initiate(
    {
      _id : "shard2rs",
      members: [
        { _id : 0, host : "127.0.3.1:27019" },
        { _id : 1, host : "127.0.3.2:27019" },
        { _id : 2, host : "127.0.3.3:27019" }
      ]
    }
  )
  ```
  If the replica set is initiated successfully, the `rs.initiate()` method returns `ok` as `1` and provides the `clusterTime` details. It initially shows that the current instance is directed to **secondary** 
  but, in few seconds, it is directed to **primary**.
  
* Run the following command to get the replica set current configuration where you can see 3 members running at `127.0.3.1:27019`, `127.0.3.2:27019` and `127.0.3.3:27019` got added to the replica set:
  ```
  rs.conf()
  ```
  
* Run the following command to get the status of replica set where you can see the current instance `127.0.3.1:27019` is set to **PRIMARY** and the other 2 instances `127.0.3.2:27019` and `127.0.3.3:27019` 
  are set to **SECONDARY**.
  ```
  rs.status()
  ```

### 9.5.Start Query Router:
Now, we will setup a query router (mongos) instance such that it is running at IP address `127.0.4.0` on port `27020`. 

#### Configure Router Instance:
Go to `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\RouterSrvr\bin` and create `mongos.cfg` file and add the below contents into it. 
```
systemLog:
  destination: file
  logAppend: true
  path: D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\RouterSrvr\log\mongos.log

net:
  bindIp: 127.0.4.0
  port: 27020

sharding:
  configDB: configrs/127.0.1.1:27018,127.0.1.2:27018
```

#### Start Router Instance:
Open a new **Command Prompt** application as **Administrator** and execute the below command to start `RouterSrvr` instance.
```
mongos --config D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\RouterSrvr\bin\mongos.cfg
```
After executing the command, do not close the window. In couple of minutes, MongoDB instance would be started. You can open `mongod.log` file from `D:\ProgramFiles\MongoDB\Server\RouterSrvr\log` and 
look for messages **"Listening on address 127.0.4.0:27020"** which indicate that MongoDB instance has been started successfully.

You can also verify if the address 127.0.4.0:27020 is listening by running the following command on another **Command Prompt** window:
```
netstat -an | find "127.0.4.0:27020"
```

### 9.6. Add Shards to Cluster:
Open a new **Command Prompt** and execute the below command to connect to the query router (mongos) instance listening at `127.0.4.0:27020` address. 
```
mongosh --host 127.0.4.0 --port 27020
```
 
When you are connected successfully, it will give you `[direct: mongos]test>` prompt to access the `test` database by default in mongos.

On the `test>` prompt, run the following command to add the first shard replica to the cluster 
```
sh.addShard("shard1rs/127.0.2.1:27019,127.0.2.2:27019,127.0.2.3:27019")
```
 
If the shard addition is successful, the `sh.addShard()` method returns the shard name that was added.

Next, run the following command to add the second shard replica to the cluster 
```
sh.addShard("shard2rs/127.0.3.1:27019,127.0.3.2:27019,127.0.3.3:27019")
```

Run the below command to check if both shards were added properly:
```
sh.status()
```
When the above command is executed, you should see two shards `shard1rs` and `shard2rs` with each shard contains 3 hosts.

### 9.7. Enable Sharding:
To take the advantage of sharded cluster, the sharding must be enabled for database and collection to store data across multiple shards within cluster. 

#### Enable Sharding for Database:
When the database within sharded cluster is not enabled with sharding, the data being inserted into database would be non-partitioned and stored in the primary shard only.

To move further, we will work on the sample sales data which will be stored in a collection called `sales` and a database called `superstore`. 
The `sales` collection will have documents with the following fields:
```
{
    "category": "Furniture",
    "subcategory": "Bookcases",
    "productname": "Bookcase",
    "city": "Henderson",
    "state": "Kentucky",
    "country": "United States",
    "region": "South",
    "quantity": 2,
    "sales": 261.96
  }
```

On the mongos command prompt, run the following command to enable sharding for `superstore` database even if this database doesn’t exist yet.
```
sh.enableSharding("superstore")
```

#### Enable Sharding for Collection:
Now that the `superstore` database is configured to allow partitioning, you must enable partitioning or sharding for the `sales` collection even if this collection does not exist yet. 

MongoDB provides two ways to shard collections:
* **Range-based sharding** which allows sharding data based on ranges of a given value. It can use multiple fields as the shard key and divides data into contiguous ranges determined by the shard key values.
* **Hashed sharding** which uses a hashed index of a single field as the shard key to partition data across the sharded cluster. 

It is always recommended to choose the field as sharding key which has high cardinality i.e. highest number of duplicate values.

Run the following command to enable hased sharding for `sales` collection with `category` field as shard key. In the below command, `category` field is set to `hashed` which indicates that hashed sharding 
is enabled on category _(if you want to enable ranged-based sharding, then set the `category` field to `1`)_.
```
sh.shardCollection("superstore.sales", { "category": "hashed" })
```

#### Insert Documents into Collection:
We will insert some sample documents into `sales` sharded collection. 

First, switch to `superstore` database using the below command:
```
use superstore
```
 
Then, run the following command to insert 25 documents into `sales` collection.
```
db.sales.insertMany([

])
```

When the above documents are inserted, MongoDB automatically distributes documents across shards based on the values of the `category` field that is defined as shard key.

Use the following command to see how documents were distributed across shards:
```
db.sales.getShardDistribution()
```
You may see that the `sales` collection consists of total 25 documents out of which few documents were distributed on the first shard `shard1rs` and remaining documents were distributed on the 
second shard `shard2rs`.

#### Analyze Shard Usage:
Sharding helps to improve the performance of the system. Based on the query executed, it scans either a single shard or all shards in the entire cluster.

By using the explain feature on the query cursor, you can check whether your query spans one or multiple shards. In turn, it can also help to determine whether the query will overload the cluster by 
reaching out to every shard at once.

Run the following command to see how the query has been executed:
```
db.sales.find().explain()
```
When the above command is executed, you can see, the query planner used **SHARD_MERGE** strategy i.e. multiple shards were used to resolve the query and dispalyed the list of shards taking part in the 
evaluation. 

Now, run the following command to filter sales data that belongs South region and see how the query is executed. 
```
db.sales.find({"region":"South"}).explain()
```
This time also, you can see the query planner has used **SHARD_MERGE** strategy to retrieve documents.

When you filter against the shard key, query planner should a different strategy. For this, run the following command to see the query planner when filtering sales data with `category=Furniture`. 
Remember that `category` field was selected as shard key while sharding `sales` collection.
```
db.sales.find({"region":"South"}).explain()
```
This time, you can see MongoDB has used a different query strategy **SINGLE_SHARD** instead of **SHARD_MERGE**. This means only a single shard was needed to satisfy the query.

## 10. PyMongo:
While MongoDB can be accessed from various programming languages including **C, C+, Java, Python** etc., it is easy to use **Python** language to query **MongoDB**.

**PyMongo** is a library available in the Python language to work with MongoDB. In other words, Python needs a MongoDB driver called PyMongo to access the MongoDB database.

### 10.1.	Install Python:
If you do not have Python installed already in your system, you can download and install the latest version from the official [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website.

After you installed python, you need to configure the **PATH** environment variable defining the Python installation path as below:
* In the Windows search bar, start typing “environment variables” and select the first match which opens up **System Properties** dialog.
* On the **System Properties** window, press **Environment Variables** button.
* In the **Environment Variables** dialog, select **PATH** variable under **User Variables** and press **Edit** button.
* Press **New** and add the location of you python installation and its `scripts` directory. Then press **OK**
  _(In my case, python was installed under D:\ProgramFiles\Python\Python313 and so, added the below values)_  
  _D:\ProgramFiles\Python\Python313  
  D:\ProgramFiles\Python\Python313\Scripts_
* Then, press **OK** again to apply environment variable changes and close window.

Open a new **Command Prompt**, and run the following command to verify the python version:
```
python --version
```

### 10.2.	Install PyMongo:
Once you have Python installed in your system, you need to install the `pymongo` library into Python.

Open a new **Command Prompt** and run the below command to install `pymongo` library:
```
pip install pymongo
```
 
### 10.3.	Connect MongoDB:
Now let’s try to connect MongoDB sharded cluster from Python.

First, start the python shell using the below command:
```
python
```

When python shell is started, it gives you `>>>` prompt to execute Python commands.

On the `>>>` prompt, run the following commands to import `pymongo` library and create a `MongoClient` object using the connection URL `mongodb://127.0.4.0:27020` which is a mongos (query router) host 
to access MongoDB:
```
import pymongo
mongoClient = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://127.0.4.0:27020")
mongoClient
```

### 10.4.	Create Database:
Once the `MongoClient` object is created successfully, you can access see the available databases and connect to a specific database. 

Let us create a `db` object to access the `supply` database _(note that this database doesnot exist yet)_. MongoDB will not create a database until a collection is created with at least one document.
```
db = mongoClient['supply']
db
```

Use the below command to list down the available databases in the Mongo cluster:
```
mongoClient.list_database_names()
```

### 10.5.	Create Collection:
Once the `db` object is created successfully, you can access see the available collections and connect to a specific collection. 

Let us create a `col` object to access the `suppliers` collection _(note that this collection doesnot exist yet)_. 

Use the below command to create a collection in MongoDB by specifying the collection name in `[]` brackets. MongoDB will not create a collection until at least one document is loaded into it.
```
col = db['suppliers']
col
```
In the above command, you can call the collection name in two ways such as `db['suppliers']` or `db.suppliers`.

Use the below command to list down the available collections in the database:
```
db.list_collection_names()
```

### 10.6.	Insert Documents:
PyMongo collection object has `insert_one()` or `insert_many()` methods to insert a single or multiple documents. Document data must be provided in JSON format with key-value pairs.

Use `insert_one()` method to insert one document into the collection. 
In the below command, `col` is the collection object that was created earlier and is pointed to `suppliers`. MongoDB assigns a unique id (`ObjectId`) for each document inserted when the document data 
does not contain `_id` field:
```
col.insert_one({"name": "Exotic Liquids", "address": "49 Gilbert St.", "city": "London", "country": "UK"})
```

The `insert_one()` method returns the `InsertOneResult` object which contains the `ObjectId` of the inserted document.  

You can print the `ObjectId` of the inserted document using `inserted_id` property of `InsertOneResult` object by storing the result of `insert_one()` method into a variable as below:
```
ins_res = col.insert_one({"name": "Tokyo Traders", "address": "9-8 Sekimai Musashino-shi", "city": "Tokyo", "country": "Japan"})
print(ins_res.inserted_id)
```

Now, use the `list_collection_names()` method to see if the `suppliers` collection is created:
```
db.list_collection_names()
```

Use `insert_many()` method to insert multiple documents at once into the collection. In this method, all documents must be specified in list form. The `insert_many()` method returns the 
`InsertManyResult` object that contains `ObjectId` of all inserted documents which you can print using `inserted_ids` property of `InsertManyResult` object by storing the result of `insert_many()` 
method into a variable as below:
```
ins_many_res = db.suppliers.insert_many([
{"name": "Ma Maison", "address": "2960 Rue St. Laurent", "city": "Montreal", "country": "Canada"},
{"name": "Bigfoot Breweries", "address": "3400 - 8th Avenue Suite 210", "city": "Bend", "country": "USA"},
{"name": "Leka Trading", "address": "471 Serangoon Loop", "city": "", "country": "Singapore"},
{"name": "Specialty Biscuits", "address": "29 King's Way", "city": "Manchester", "country": "USA"}
])

print(ins_many_res.inserted_ids)
```

### 10.7.	Find Documents:
PyMongo collection object has `find_one()` and `find()` methods to retrieve a single or multiple documents from a collection. Both these methods can take 2 parameters where the first parameter indicates 
the JSON form of filter criteria and second parameter indicates the JSON form of fields to be included or excluded.

Use `find_one()` method to select a single document data from the collection. It always returns the first occurrence in the selection. 

Run the below command to get the first document in the `suppliers` collection:
```
db.suppliers.find_one()
```
or
```
db.suppliers.find_one({})
```

Run the below command to retrieve the first document which contains `country=USA` the `suppliers` collection:
```
db.suppliers.find_one({"country": "USA"})
```

Use `find()` method to retrieve multiple documents from the collection. It returns a cursor object which you must loop in to see the actual document data. The `find()` method without any parameter is 
equivalent to `SELECT *` command in relational databases.

Run the below commands to get all documents from the `suppliers` collection:
```
find_res = db.suppliers.find({})
print(find_res)
for doc in find_res:
	print(doc)
```

Run the below commands to get all documents which contains `country=USA` from the `suppliers` collection:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find({"country": "USA"}):
	print(doc)
```
 
Run the below commands to get all documents which contains `address` field value starting with `'3'` or greater than `'3'` from the `suppliers` collection:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find({"address": {"$gt": "3"}}):
	print(doc)
```

Run the below commands to get all documents which contains `city` starting with `'M'` but this time, exclude (indicating with `0`) `_id` field and include (indicating with `1`) only `name` and `city` 
fields in the output:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find({"city": {"$regex": "^M"}}, {'_id': 0, "name": 1, "city": 1}):
	print(doc)
```

Use `limit()` method to limit the result set in MongoDB. This method expects one integer parameter defining the numbers of documents to return.

Run the below commands to get top 3 documents from the `suppliers` collection:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find().limit(3):
	print(doc)
```

Use `sort()` method to sort the result set in either ascending or descending order. This method takes 2 parameters where the first parameter indicates the fieldname and second parameter indicates the 
sort order (use `1` for ascending and `-1` descending). The default sort order is ascending.

Run the below commands to retrieve all documents sorted by `country` in ascending order from `suppliers` collection:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find().sort("country"):
	print(doc)
```

Run the below commands to retrieve all documents sorted by `country` in descending order from `suppliers` collection:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find().sort("country", -1):
	print(doc)
```

### 10.8.	Count Documents:
Use `count_documents()` method of collection object to get the number of documents available in a collection. This method expects one parameter, just pass the empty dictionary `{}` to count the total documents 
in a collection.
```
db.suppliers.count_documents({})
```

You can pass the filter criteria to `count_documents()` to get the count of documents matching the query criteria.
```
db.suppliers.count_documents({"country": "USA"})
```

### 10.9.	Update Documents:
PyMongo collection object has `update_one()` and `update_many()` methods to update one or more documents in a collection. Both these methods expect 2 parameters, the first parameter is the query object 
or filter criteria defining which documents to update and the second parameter is the object defining the new values of the document. 

Use `update_one()` method to update a single document data in the collection. If the query to update finds more than one document, then this method updates the first occurrence.

Run the below commands to update `address` from `29 King's Way` to `45 Manchester` in the `suppliers` collection:
```
query = {"address": "29 King's Way"}
new_val = {"$set": {"address": "45 Manchester"}}
db.suppliers.update_one(query, new_val)
```
The `update_one()` method returns the `UpdateResult` object which has `matched_count` property defining the number of documents matched with the query specified and `modified_count` property defining the 
number of documents updated which you can print as below:
```
query = {"address": "45 Manchester"}
new_val = {"$set": {"address": "29 King's Way"}}
update_res = db.suppliers.update_one(query, new_val)
print(update_res.matched_count)
print(update_res.modified_count)
```

Use `update_many()` method to update multiple documents at once if it meets the query criteria.

Run the below command to update `country` starting with `USA` to `United States` in the `suppliers` collection and print the number of documents that got updated:
```
query = {"country" : {"$regex" : "^US"}}
new_val = {"$set" : {"country" : "United States"}}
update_res = db.suppliers.update_many(query, new_val)
print(f"{update_res.modified_count} documents are updated")
```

Then, use the `find()` method to see the latest data:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find():
	print(doc)
```

PyMongo provides `replace_one()` method to replace an entire document.

Run the below commands to replace the first document from the `suppliers` collection where `name : Exotic Liquids` and display the latest data.
```
query = {"name" : "Exotic Liquids"}
new_doc = {"name": "Exotic Liquids Ltd", 'address': '49 Gilbert Street', 'city': 'London', 'country': 'United Kingdom'}
replace_res = db.suppliers.replace_one(query, new_doc)
print(f"{replace_res.modified_count} documents are replaced")
for doc in db.suppliers.find():
	print(doc)
```
 
### 10.10. Delete Documents:
PyMongo collection object has `delete_one()` and `delete_many()` methods to delete one or more documents from a collection. Both these methods expects a query or filter criteria defining which documents 
to be deleted. 

Use `delete_one()` method to delete a single document. This method returns the `DeleteResult` object which has `deleted_count` property defining the number of deleted documents which you can print.

Run the below commands to delete document where `name: Leka Trading` from the `suppliers` collection and print the number of deleted records:
```
delete_res=db.suppliers.delete_one({"name": "Leka Trading"})
print(delete_res.deleted_count)
```

If you want to delete the first document in the collection, then just pass an empty query using `{}` to `delete_one()` method:
```
db.suppliers.delete_one({})
```

PyMongo also provides `find_one_and_delete()` method to delete a single document based on the filter and sort criteria and returns the deleted document 
```
db.suppliers.find_one_and_delete({'name': 'Ma Maison'})
```

Then, use the `find()` method to see the available documents in the collection:
```
for doc in db.suppliers.find():
	print(doc)
```

Use `delete_many()` method to delete multiple documents at once if it meets the query criteria.

Run the below commands to delete documents where `country : United States` in the `suppliers` collection and print the number of documents that got deleted.
```
delete_res=db.suppliers.delete_many({"country": "United States"})
print(delete_res.deleted_count)
```

If you want to delete all documents in the collection, then just pass an empty query using `{}` to `delete_many()` method:
```
del_many_res = db.suppliers.delete_many({})
print(f"{del_many_res.deleted_count} documents were deleted")
print(f"Total documents available: {db.suppliers.count_documents({})}")
```

### 10.11. Drop Collection:
PyMongo collection object has `drop()` method to drop the collection from the database. This method returns `True` if the collection was dropped successfully or `False` if the collection does not exist. 
If the database consists of single collection which gets dropped, then database also gets dropped automatically.

Run the below commands to drop suppliers collection and see the list of available collections and databases:
```
db.suppliers.drop()
print(db.list_collection_names())
mongoClient.list_database_names()
```
 
You can see, as soon as `suppliers` collection was dropped, `supply` database got dropped automatically since it consists of `suppliers` collection only.
